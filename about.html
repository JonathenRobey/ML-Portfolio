            <h1>[Your Name]</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio. I am a passionate Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in mechanical engineering and computer science. Currently, I am enrolled in the Master of Science in Computer Science program specializing in Machine Learning at Georgia Tech.</p>
            <p>My journey into the world of data and AI began during my time as a product development engineer at Meviy, where I worked on advanced manufacturing platforms. With a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan-Dearborn and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering from Olivet Nazarene University, I have built a solid foundation in engineering principles and practices.</p>
            <p>I have a keen interest in applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems, especially in the areas of predictive maintenance, data integration, and process optimization. My coursework and projects have equipped me with skills in various machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and software development.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my projects and articles to learn more about my work and interests. If you'd like to connect, please visit the contact page.</p>
